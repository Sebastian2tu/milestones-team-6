This file contains a function ColumnSort that will sort a list of files using columnsort. Currently, it requires one to open MATLAB and run the function in the MATLAB command editor:
ColumnSort(filename). 
It is not completely implemented yet, so it only returns the dimensions of the matrix that will be used to sort the values.
