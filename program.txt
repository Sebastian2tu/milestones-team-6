Our program will implement the columnsort algorithm in MATLAB. This will sort a list of integers that are passed in through a file.
We feel that this would be the best way to showcase MATLAB as it is a language based on matrixes, and this algorithm focuses on sorting values via a matrix.

We expect the program to have numerous functions related matrix manipulation, one to read in the list of integers,
and a couple for outputting purposes and sorting.

We expect the program to be approximately 300 lines.
